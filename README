== Disclaimer ==

This is reseach code writen in a "lab" language (Matlab) and, as such, one
shouldn't expect it to be ready for production. The implementation produces the
results in the paper, and may well be very useful, but it may be *hugely*
improved. We're working on better algorithms, but this one works OK. Feel free
to develop and publish better algorithms yourself. But, above all, don't blame
us if you see any imperfections in this research code. Oh, and don't forget:
please cite this paper ;^)
